### DJANGO
- THis is a python web framework (a software framework that simplifies the development of web apps by providing
a structure and common  components (tools and libs to handle common web dev tasks) )

1. routing : mapping url routes to various pages or functionalities
2. Authentication : authorization , identity
3. Database integration and interaction
4. Session Management
5. Form Handling

Examples
Backend Frameworks
1. NodeJS
2. Python (Flask and Django)
3. PHP (Laravel)
4. Ruby on Rails
5. GO (GIN, ECHO)

Frontend Framework
1. React JS
2. Next JS
3. Angular
4. Vue


### A DJANGO WEBSITE
- This typically consists of a single Project , that is then spilt into separates apps
   Instagram (case study)
   - user management : Logging in and out , registering , forgot password
   - media features : upload, edit and display media
   - messaging : send messages

- django apps are structured to separate the logic pieces
- django supports the architecural pattern of MVC.
  - Models : define the data. This is usually the database description and often the base layer to an app.
  - Views : display some or all data and also enable client interaction. HTML AND CSS things
  - Controllers : handles how the database and the views interact
- django recognizes above as an MVT pattern
  - Models : define the data. This is usually the database description and often the base layer to an app.
  - Views : url mapping logic
  - Templates : HTML and CSS , where to also interact with jinja templating. 



### Conclusion:
A django site starts off as a project , and its built up with a number of apps that handle separate functionalities. Each app follows the
MVT pattern.


### Tools to work with django
1. Python - python --version
            python3 --version

2. pip  -  pip install django
3. python -m django --version

### How to create to django projects

python -m django-admin startproject PROJECTNAME

### How to run the django server

- cd projectname
- python manage.py runserver

### How to add an app

- python manage.py startapp todo
- next register the app to the project , in settings.py on project folder
add it to the installed apps list

### How to map models to database tables (applying migrations)
1. Define the model
2. make the migrations ( python manage.py makemigrations )
3. apply the migrations ( python manage.py migrate )

### AGENDA 
1. Databases 
2. Objects Relationships

### Install an sqlite viewer 
1. go to file -> settings -> plugins on sidebar
2. ctrl + alt + s to open settings 
3. go to installed tab 
4. ensure the plugin Database Tools and SQL is checked 
5. if not present search in marketplace 
6. double click on desired view for db
7. right click to check if database drivers are enabled 
8. If not installed , click to install 
9. right click to get to properties 
10. check the general tab , to ensure sqlite URL is correctly mapped to 
your project 
11. check the schema tab and allow the schema you want or all to visualize
all schemas 
12. Locate the schema , then double click to visualize table for app.

### Databases
A database is an organized system for storing , managing and retrieving data in an efficient and organized 
manner 
- Maintain persitency on data. Manipulate the data 

### Database Structure 
Key elements of the structure 
1. Tables : primary structure for organizing data , where data is stored in rows and columns 
2. Columns : Represents specific attributes or props for the items in each row. Each column will
have a data type like text, integer or date ....
3. Primary Key : A unique id for each row , ensuring no row has the same Primary key , making it
easier to access and manage individual records 
4. Foreign Key : A field in one table that links to the primary key of another table , creating 
relationships between the tables 

### Database Types 
Classified by how they store data, the type of relationships they support and the design 

a. Relational Databases (RDBMS)
use tables to store data with predefined relationships between the tables. 
Each table has rows and columns where relationships are established using PK and FK 

examples : MySQL , PostgreSQL , Oracle , SQL server , sqlite

Advantage: High data integrity , SQL support , support for complex queries through SQL joins 

b. NoSQL Databases 
store data in non-tabular forms , which makes them suitable for unstructured , unrelated or semi
structured data 
Document-Oriented sequence : JSON-like documents 

Example : Google Firebase , MongoDB 

c. In-Memory db's : storage happens in main memory rather than disks (RAM) 
Example : Redis 

d. Object-Oriented Databases 
storage of data in objects
example : ObjectDB 

e. Distributed databases 
Data is stored across different locations and interconnected through a network 
Example : Google Spanner , Apache Cassandra 


### Database Attributes and Fields (Columns)
1. Data types : define the kind of data to be stored in each column. (text, integer, date , boolean)
2. Constraint : Rules to be applied to the data to ensure data integrity (NOT NULL, NULL , UNIQUE, length)4
3. Indexes : Special data structures that improve query performance by allowing fast retrieval of rows usings keys columns 
4. Schemas : Describe the structure of the db. includes the tables , 
relationships, views and permission. 

### Database Operations
- CRUD operations : Create , read, update, delete 
- Query : retrieve specific data using SQL : Structured query language 
- Transactions: group operations within single units

### Database Relationships 
Defining how data in different tables relate to one another 
1. One to One : Each row in one table is linked to one row in another table 
2. One to Many : A row in one table can be linked to multiple rows in another
table 
3. Many to Many : Rows in one table are linked multiple rows in another table
, often managed using a join table 

### ORM : Object Relational Mapping 
this is a programming technique allowing us to interact with a relational db using 
oop.
Key usage 
- replaces the need for writing raw SQL queries instead we use the objects to perform
db operations , makes our code cleaner and more maintainable 

Python Flask = SQLAlchemy ORM 
Python Django = Django ORM 

### Django ORM 
Allows interaction with databases using python classes and methods rather than raw SQL. 
Breakdown :
1. Each model class represents a table in the database 
2. Each instance/object of that class will represent a row in the table

### Basic concepts of Django ORM 
1. Model : a python class to represent the table 
2. Querysets : A collection of db rows represented as objects which can be filtered
ordered and manipulated 
3. Migrations : A way to apply db schema changes i.e. creating tables 

### APIS(Application Programming Interfaces)
-Set of rules and tools that allow software applications to communicate with each other e.g. A django app can communicate 
with an Android app. 
- Defines how different software components should interact, enabling seamless data sharing and functionalities btw 
the application

### what is REST ? (Representational State Transfer)
- this is an architectural style for designing APIs
- REST relies on standard HTTP methods and focuses on making systems stateless and scalable 
## Key features of REST 
1. Stateless : Each request from a client contains all the info. needed to process it and the server does not 
store any CLIENT state 
2. HTTP methods : Common methods 
- GET : Retrieve Data 
- POST  :  Create the new data 
- PUT/PATCH : Update data 
- Delete : Delete Data 
3. Resources : Everything is treated as a resource (e.g. users , products ) and each has a unique URL 
4. Format : Typically uses JSON or XML for data exchange 


### JSON (Javascript Object Notation)
JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format. 
Widely used in API for data exchange 

JSON OBJECT -> 
{
  "key" : "value"
}

JSON ARRAY
[
{
  "key" : "value"
   },
{
  "key" : "value"
},
{
  "key" : "value"
}
]


### Approach to Developing APIS 
1. Understand Requirements 
- identify what the API needs to do.
2. Designing the API 
- REST way , GraphQL 
- design the route and specify input/output
- API versioning and documentation (SWAGGER ? POSTMAN)

3. Build the API 
- select the framework to use (DJANGO , EXPRESS IN JS ,FLASK )
- Implement the endpoints '/tasks' '/task/<int:id>' usingt the HTTP methods
- validations and if necessary implement authentication.

4. Test the API 
- test the api for performance , security, and proper data handling tools (POSTMAN)

5. Deploy and maintain for live use. 

### DJANGO APPROACH TO BUILDING THE APIS 
1. Django REST Framework 
- DRF is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building web apps in DJANGO 
Steps 
- Install DRF : pip install djangorestframework 
- Define models for data 
- Create serializers to convert btw JSON and model instances 
- Define API Views and use DRF generic views for common patterns 
- use routers to handle URL Routing 

2. Using core DJANGO 
- popular for simpler project
- DJANGO built in JSONRESPONSE and your simple views for routing functionality


### Steps for creation 
1. Create and register the second app to our project
python manage.py startapp todo_api
2. Install DRF (djangorestframework)
pip install djangorestframework
3. Models : 
- user : one to many relationship todos
- tag : many to many relationship with todos 
- tasks : data to define todos. 

task : buy groceries 
tag : urgent, personal 
- A task can have multiple tags 
- A tag can be associated to multiple tasks 

tag : urgent 
Buy Groceries , Pay bills 

4. Make the migrations 
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

5. Set up of serializers
a. create a serializers.py file 

6. Create the viewsets in view.py :: CRUD operations
7. Create the urls.py file for our app 
8. Create the urls paths for the app 
9. Register the apps urls to the project urls 
10. Test : 
using a tool like POSTMAN then run the project and test
the endpoints. 
- open settings, get to the marketplace , search and install postman~~~~

### Serializers 
-Serializers are used to convert model instances to simple python data types
e.g. list , dictionary , which enables them to be easily rendered into 
JSON 
- Conversely, serializers also handle converting incoming data back into 
django model instances for saving into database 
Summary 
a. Serialization : Converting python object i.e. model instance into JSON
for API responses 
b. deserialization : converting incoming python objects into model instances 
for creating or updating records 


### Types of serializers in DRF (DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK)
1. ModelSerializer 
- Class that acts a shortcut i.e. it auto. generates and validates fields 
based on the model 
2. Standard Serializer 
- Used when we need more control over the serialization process 
- Does not depend on the model for validation and generation , i.e. needs 
explicit definations. 

### DJANGO AUTHENTICATION 
Django comes with a ready user authentication system 
1. Handle user accounts 
2. Permissions for users 
3. Cookie-based user sessions 

Authentication and Authorization 
The auth system consist of the following 
1. User model 
2. Permission flags : yes/no : user may perform a certain task 
3. A configurable password hashing system
4. Form and view tools for logging in users and restricting content 
5. A pluggable backend system (customize what django does by default.)

## installation 
happens on creation of the django project 
- django-admin startproject
- "django.contrib.auth", : core of the authentication framework , default models (User)
- "django.contrib.contenttypes", : linking to our own customization.

## once you have extended the default auth model then :
1. make the migrations ( python manage.py makemigrations )
2. apply the migrations ( python manage.py migrate )


### preventive measures 
1. Define the custom user model early : let it be the first app we create 
2. Run the migrations for above model first 
3. Test migrations for this as we bring in our other applications 

django.db.migrations.exceptions.InconsistentMigrationHistory: Migration admin.0001_initial is applied before its dependency accounts.0001_initial on database 'default'.

Assessment 
1. Create a new django project 
2. Create the accounts app first : so that we avoid inconsitiencies btw the authentication layer django and our new customization. 
3. Run the migrations and test app 
4. Bring in the other apps.
